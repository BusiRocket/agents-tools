# Validation

## Goal

Ensure code quality through validation checks.

## Validation Rule

After meaningful changes, run:

- Project standard checks (e.g. `yarn check:all` or `cargo check` / `cargo clippy`).

## Examples

```bash
# ✅ Correct - run checks after changes
yarn check:all
# or
cargo clippy
```

```bash
# ❌ Incorrect - skip checks
# Made changes but didn't verify quality
```

## Best Practices

- Always run checks after meaningful changes
- Fix issues before committing
- Use checks as quality gate
